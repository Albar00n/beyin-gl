The tree has a root at level 0, with one\n * single tile. On every level, each tile is divided into four children (therefore the name\n * quadtree).\n *\n * Within each [[level]], any particular tile is addressed with [[row]] and [[column]]. The number\n * of rows and columns in each level is 2 to the power of the level. This means: On level 0, only\n * one tile exists, [[columnsAtLevel]]() and [[rowsAtLevel]]() are both 1. On level 1, 4 tiles\n * exist, in 2 rows and 2 columns. On level 2 we have 16 tiles, in 4 rows and 4 columns. And so on.\n *\n * A tile key is usually created using [[fromRowColumnLevel]]() method.\n *\n * `TileKey` instances are immutable, all members return new instances of `TileKey` and do not\n * modify the original object.\n *\n * Utility functions like [[parent]](), [[changedLevelBy]](), and [[changedLevelTo]]() allow for\n * easy vertical navigation of the tree. The number of available rows and columns in the tile's\n * level is given with [[rowCount]]() and [[columnCount]]().\n *\n * Tile keys can be created from and converted into various alternative formats:\n *\n *  - [[toQuadKey]]() / [[fromQuadKey]]() - string representation 4-based\n *  - [[toHereTile]]() / [[fromHereTile]]() - string representation 10-based\n *  - [[mortonCode]]() / [[fromMortonCode]]() - number representation\n *\n * Note - as JavaScript's number type can hold 53 bits in its mantissa, only levels up to 26 can be\n * represented in the number representation returned by [[mortonCode]]().\n */\nexport class TileKey {\n    /**\n     * Creates a tile key.\n     *\n     * @param row - The requested row.
